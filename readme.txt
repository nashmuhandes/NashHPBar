Nash's HP Bar v1.0
------------------

Just a HP bar. Nothing else!

Intentionally no customizability. I wanted to keep it clean and simple.

Can be toggled on and off. Useful in a coop game where some players may not
want their screen to be cluttered, but all players must have the mod loaded
to prevent desyncs.

The bar's position will always be drawn such so that it will never obscure
your pickup messages. It also respects message scale settings and the number
of lines as determined by the 'con_notifylines' CVAR.

Have fun!
